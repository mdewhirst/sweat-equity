sweat-equity
============

These documents are the basis of a sweat-equity project which I intend to commence in the near future. 

They are easier to read if you click the Wiki link above and select the Pages tab.

For my own project, while it would be great to have a co-located dev team it would seem to be difficult if not impossible to achieve. Hence for a sweat-equity project it is assumed most or even all dev team members would be working remotely.

The aim of both sets of guidelines is to ease the interface between Stakeholders and Developers. Naturally it assumes these are two separate groups although in many projects such lines can be blurred.

The equity agreement is intended to provide some structure for developers able to work for equity instead of salary. 

I wrote these documents and put them in the public domain here at github. Maybe they will help others get started on projects which have not yet achieved venture funding. 

Feel free to use and improve them and thank you very much for your comments and feedback.

Contact me directly if you are interested in a non-disclosure agreement.

PS: The .txt files are minimally marked-up in Markdown and you should have no difficulty seeing through that. The equity_agreement.odt is in open document format (written using OpenOffice.org) and also exported as a .pdf file. I believe MS Office can read .odt files.
