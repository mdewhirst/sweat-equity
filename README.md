sweat-equity
============

These documents are the basis of a sweat-equity project which I intend to 
commence in the near future. Maybe they will help others get started on 
projects which have not yet achieved venture funding.

The aim of both guidelines files is to ease the interface between Stakeholders 
and Developers. Naturally it assumes these are two separate groups although in 
many projects such lines can be blurred.

I wrote them and put them in the public domain here at github for the sole 
purpose of seeing your improvements.

Feel free to use and improve them and thank you very much for your comments and 
feedback. 

Contact me directly if you are interested in a non-disclosure agreement.

PS: The .txt files are minimally marked-up for Edgewall Software's Trac issues
tracking wiki and you should have no difficulty seeing through that. The 
sweat_equity_agreement.odt is in open document format (written using OpenOffice.org)
and also exported as a .pdf file. I believe MS Office can read .odt files.
