## Change request

(For this to make sense you need an existing ticketing system such as Trac by Edgewall Software)

1. Name the requested change in as few words as possible. The name will be used as a summary.

2. Write a description in 50 words or fewer. This will be used in reports listing all change requests. It should be a compelling read for Stakeholders thinking about a priority for it to be developed.

3. Create a New Ticket for the change

  * Put the name (1 above) into the Summary field

  * Put the description (2 above) into the Description field

  * Choose between _defect_, _enhancement_ or _task_ as the type of change

  * Optionally adjust the priority of the ticket. Choose a bug priority if it is a ticket for a defect.

  * Optionally enter one or more keywords to assist searching through changes

  * Add any email addresses (separated by a space) for people interested in this ticket. They will receive an email if the ticket is updated during its life.

  * Enter the name of the owner. This should be you unless you have agreed otherwise with someone else.

  * Click Preview and when comfortable, click Create ticket

## Optionally create a wiki page.

If the change is an enhancement request or a task requiring specification, more detail and possibly discussion will be required. If so, a wiki page may be appropriate as well.

  * Invent a single CamelCase word to be the page name (eg., the page name of this page is !ChangeRequest)

  * Put that word into the search box (top right) and click Search to create the new wiki page

  * Use the same summary as the title of the page

  * Refer to the ticket number

  * Borrow from the ticket description and write the case for change

  * Write the specification using success tests which can be used for acceptance testing

  * Edit the ticket and include a reference to the wiki page (just the page name - first dot-point above - is required)

  * Email the stakeholders list using the summary title as the email subject line and announce the change request. Mention the ticket number. It will then be considered at the next Stakeholder meeting.

Note: It is only necessary to work up detailed specifications in a wiki page if Stakeholders give the ticket a greater than _normal_ priority. There is no point doing too much work if development is a long way off. Things change!
