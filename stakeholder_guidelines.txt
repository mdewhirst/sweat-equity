= Guidelines for Stakeholders =
----
== Stakeholder responsibilities ==

* Make decisions based exclusively on business value - to Stakeholders

* Initiate (and thereby own) change requests for new features

* Be available to Developers to answer occasional questions

----
== How does the project make progress? ==

* Stakeholders meet to prioritise the work backlog

* The development team takes work from the top of the backlog

* The dev team builds, tests and delivers a feature to the "owning" Stakeholder

* The Stakeholder accepts or rejects the work

* At the Stakeholder meeting accepted work is tagged for inclusion in the next release

* Developers write release notes and engineer deployment of the next release

Note: Exactly the same procedure applies for bugs and bugfixes except that bugs (other than minor) automatically get a higher priority than features.

== Stakeholder Checklists ==

=== General ===
1. Have I blocked out my diary for all future scheduled Stakeholder meetings

2. Am I on the Stakeholder mailing list

3. Have I given my contact details to the developer(s) working on my features

=== Features ===

1. Is this feature the smallest possible amount of stand-alone "usefulness" I can define or should I split it into two or more features

2. Does this feature have a meaningful name/summary which clearly identifies it in conversations

3. Can I describe it (in overview) in 50 words so it recommends itself to other Stakeholders when prioritising the backlog

4. Have I raised a [ChangeRequest ticket] ready for consideration by all Stakeholders at the next scheduled opportunity

5. Have I listed enough success tests so it can be accepted or rejected when done

6. If I created a wiki page - have I added a link to the wiki page in the ticket '''and''' a link to the ticket in the wiki page
